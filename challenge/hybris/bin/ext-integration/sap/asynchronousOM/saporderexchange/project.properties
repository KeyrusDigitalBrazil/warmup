# Configure order key generator so that it fits to ERP VBELN (CHAR10)
# As implemented in the default outbound mapping, hybris Order number will be the same as ERP order number.
# Therefore it is required to have:
# - separate number ranges (start values) per hybris installation connected to an SAP backend
#   -> should be maintained in the local.properties file of the config folder
# - have the number range of ERP sales documents set up to that provided external number will be accepted.
#   This is done in transaction VN01
