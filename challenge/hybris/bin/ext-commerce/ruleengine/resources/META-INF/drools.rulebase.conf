# This option, regulating the behaviour of kie session cache, can have 3 values:
# none (default) means that there's no cache,
# sync means that a session is reset synchronously when it gets disposed and added to the cache,
# async means that this resetting process is performed asynchronously by a different thread.
#
# To override this option one of the methods, listed below, could be used (in order of priority):
# * as a JVM property drools.sessionCache
# * in the file /drools.rulebase.conf in user home (System.getProperty("user.home"))
# * in the file drools.rulebase.conf found in the startup folder

drools.sessionCache = sync
