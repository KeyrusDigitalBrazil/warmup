;vendor8_1209761;;8X25 IS;8X25 IS;Just 12 cm wide and weighing only 490g. the new 8x25 IS binoculars are the most compact and lightweight IS binoculars Canon has ever developed.<br/><br/>- Compact, lightweight design<br/>- Tilt Mechanism Image Stabiliser<br/>- 8x magnification power<br/>- Rounded shape<br/>- Field flattener lens<br/>- Simple and convenient to use<br/>- Battery allows 6 hours of continuous operation<br/>- Centrally mounted controls.<br/><br/>Canon's smallest and lightest IS Binoculars<br/><br/>The new IS binoculars have an appealing rounded shaped design for more comfortable handling. They owe their small size, low weight and superb image-stabilising ability to the latest in Image Stabilisation technology: the Tilt Mechanism. This mechanism keeps your subject steady by correcting movements, such as hand shake. Battery power is minimised because the IS optics only uses power when the IS button is pressed. Like the focusing knob, this button is centrally located on the binoculars, easily reachable by both left and right handed users. As a further refinement, the tilt-system Image Stabiliser of the 8x25 IS suppresses chromatic aberrations and reduces colour ‘smearing’ in order to keep your image clear. Being environmentally conscious Canon have used lead-free glass in the new IS binoculars.

A robust construction includes dust and moisture resistant seals to protect against harsh weather conditions.<br/><br/><b>Hybrid Image Stabilizer</b><br/>The new Image Stabilizer designed specifically for inclusion in a macro lens. It is able to correct lens shift movement as well as the angular movement that most IS systems can correct. This provides 2-stops of correction during 1.0x magnification, increasing to 3-stops at 0.5x magnification and 4-stops during normal shooting.<br/><br/><b>Ultra low dispersion (UD) lens element ensures high image quality</b><br/>A UD element within the lens design effectively removes chromatic aberration. This allows for excellent image quality with high resolution, high contrast and excellent colour reproduction.<br/><br/><b>Focus limiter switch</b><br/>To enhance the photographer’s use of the lens, it is fitted with a 3 position focus limiter switch. With limits for close up subjects, distant subjects and all subjects, the user is able to increase the autofocus speed making quick shots a possibility.<br/><br/><b>Beautiful background blur with 9 blade circular aperture</b><br/>A circular blade aperture helps to create attractive, even background bokeh when isolating subjects at wide apertures.<br/><br/><b>Fast quiet auto focus</b><br/>The ring USM (Ultrasonic Motor) drives extremely rapid auto focus with near-silent operation. Full time mechanical manual focus override is available without having to switch out of AF. The lens offers a minimum focusing distance of 0.3m.

Clear picture quality can be enough resolution for printing up to poster size. A robust mounted image processor allows for rich gradation, fast and high quality picture processing.<br/><br/><b>dual image stabilisation (OIS + DIS)</b><br/>Blurry images can be caused by many factors, such as hand shaking, zooming or insufficient light. Dual Image Stabilisation eliminates the blur caused by camera shake and delivers clear, crisp images every time-even under difficult lighting situations. Integrating the best lens shifting mechanisms of Optical Image Stabilisation (OIS) with the sophisticated algorithms of Digital Image Stabilisation (DIS), Dual Image Stabilisation - another superior SAMSUNG innovation - corrects even the tiniest of shakes.<br/><br/><b>smart auto</b><br/>Taking the perfect photo shouldn't be left just to the professionals.

And with different level settings, you can control the amount of retouching that takes place - it's that simple! Plus, the ultra-intelligent Smile and Blink detection technologies will never let you ruin another picture-perfect moment again by detecting when the subjects' eyes are open and their smiles are at their peak.<br/><br/><b>frame guide</b><br/>Imagine being able to compose a photo even before it's shot. The world's first Frame Guide feature on the PL60 has turned that into reality. The Frame Guide feature allows you easily set up the composition of the shot so it can be used as a guide for the photographer. Simply hand off the camera and you'll never have to be missing from another photo. Now your vacation pictures will come out exactly the way you envisioned them.<br/><br/><b>5x optical zoom lens</b><br/>The 5x zoom will let you get close to the action without letting the bulkiness of the camera get in the way. This versatile camera surpasses the competition with its enhanced usability so you won’t miss another shot. The outstanding picture quality of the camera is achieved by the multi-coating on both sides of the lenses to reduce chromatic aberration and distortion so your photos come out picture perfect.<br/><br/><b>2.7”intelligent LCD (230K)</b><br/>The SAMSUNG PL60 has a 2.7"" LCD for improved contrast and colour reproduction, allowing you to enjoy a wider and clearer image. Also the SAMSUNG PL60's intelligent LCD brightness automatically detects environmental illumination and adjusts LCD brightness for optimal image viewing.<br/><br/><b>smart album</b><br/>With a 4GB SD card your camera can store up to 2000 7-megabyte photos - that's a lot to keep track of!

Natural correction when there is large brightness difference within the frame.<br/><br/><b>ISO 3200</b><br/>With a true ISO 3200 setting, your SAMSUNG camera can effectively minimise noise for crystal clear images. The super speed sensitive ISO 3200 feature give you the ability to take amazingly detailed photos-even under low light conditions.

The unique makeup of the Smart Touch buttons with large 2.5 inch LCD on the back of the camera is expected to be great fun for users, giving them an experience unlike anything they have tried before.<br/><br/><b>The superior Schneider-KREUZNACH lens</b><br/>The superior Schneider-KREUZNACH lens produces crystal clear images. <br/>Bright lens that start at f2.8 delivers even resolution from the centre to the edges. For more natural-looking pictures, each lens surface is multi-coated to minimize the ""ghost"" or ""flare"" phenomenon.<br/><br/><b>Pop-Up Flash</b><br/>The most distinctive feature of the new NV Series is the built-in pop-up flash. The use of a pop-up mechanism made the overall design simple yet luxurious, and its location, right above the lens, hugely improved light diffusion angles and transmission rates. The lens location is also ideal for delivering the flashlight as intended, since it prevents accidental blocking of the flash by a hand.<br/><br/><b>Advanced Shake Reduction</b><br/>The ASR technology prevents the degradation of image clarity and colour common to flash photography. With ASR the effects of camera shake are reduced in lower light conditions. You can even take well exposed, sharper pictures in low light without using a flash at all.
